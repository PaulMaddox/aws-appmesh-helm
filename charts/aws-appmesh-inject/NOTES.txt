AWS App Mesh injector has now been installed as a mutating webhook admission controller.

To enable automatic AWS App Mesh sidecar injection for a namespace, you need to label the namespace with appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled

For example:
$ kubectl label namespace default appmesh.k8s.aws/sidecarInjectorWebhook=enabled
